This repository contains the code to the anonymous question and answer product (quewer) built at startup, Stride (http://stride.ai/)

This product was not launched due to other plans at the company. 

But, had great fun developing it with no experience back then. It was entirely built using Django Python. 

If you have any doubts in any parts, you can contact us at kruthika.vishwa@gmail.com, panditpriyanka93@gmail.com or pooja.jagdish0@gmail.com
